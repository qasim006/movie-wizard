# Movie Wizard

Movie Wizard is a web app that lets you search for information about movies using the OMDb API. You can enter the name of a movie and the app will fetch data from the API and display it on the page.

## Getting started

To use the app, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter the name of a movie in the input field and click the "Search" button. The app will fetch data from the OMDb API and display it on the page.

## How it works

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the structure of the page, while the CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styles for the page elements. The JavaScript file (`index.js`) contains the code that fetches data from the OMDb API and displays it on the page.

The app uses the `fetch` function to make an HTTP request to the OMDb API. The response from the API is a JSON object that contains information about the movie, such as the title, poster, plot, and cast. The app uses this data to create a dynamic HTML layout that displays the information to the user.
